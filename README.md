# 1v1-game-server

A server application for a 1v1 game written in C++

---

A server application written in C++ using SFML. The server application uses UDP to communicate with the client. 

Easiest way to install this is to download buildable.zip, unzip it and run build.sh.
Make sure you have SFML installed on your computer.
If not, you can use 
  sudo apt install libsfml-dev (Linux distributions that use apt) 
  or
  brew install sfml (macOS)

####Disclaimer:
Using this application, or parts of the code, is highly discouraged. Seriously. Go read a book.
